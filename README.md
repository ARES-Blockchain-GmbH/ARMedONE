Why?

In times of rapidly growing demand of IT-components, micro electronics and chips in general; times of tremendous growth of cloud computing and the need of faster, better but at the same time smaller and more sustained hardware, we asked us one question:
Is the current state of tech, big tower computers and even bigger servers, the right track to follow?
After long research we decided: NO!
That’s why we, ARES Blockchain GmbH, a company based in the lovely city Duisburg in germany, is thrilled to announce our “next big thing”: The ARMedONE Cluster Carrier Mainboard of our Dreams!
This board allows us all to take things back in our own hands and to get more compute power in much smaller space requirements then every other mainboard in the market while assuring full modularity!

What?

The ARMedONE is a pc/server mainboard housing up to 28 Compute Modules like Nvidia Jetson, Raspbery PI CM3/4 or many more.
While providing all this space the Board contains the dimensions of the E-ATX formfactor. So we made sure it’ll fit in every E-ATX PC Case on the market and even in Rack-Servers, too.
This saves enourmous amounts of space while packing as much “horse power” (CPU/RAM/GPU-Cores) on the E-ATX sizes.
But we didn’t stop there!
To make things even easier the board powers all 28 Compute Modules from a single PSU, using the well known ATX Power Standard. So it’s up to the users what kind of PSU they want to use. Just through the one in you have laying around in your Basement! It’s fine.
Furthermore the whole Networking is done by a single RJ45 cable, too.
We added a network switch directly onto the motherboard. So every Compute Module gets it’s connection without the need of any more cabeling.

The ARMedONE provides all I/O you’ll ever need:
•	HDMI
•	3x USB-A
•	USB-C
•	RJ45 network
•	PCIe
•	28x MicroSD port for each module slot cutting down module costs

Speaking of Compute Modules

The ARMedONE works with every SO-DIMM based Compute Module like Nvidia Jetson, Xavier NX and many more.
But we’ll make sure to enable even Boards like the RaspberyPI CM3/4 by supplying our own Adapter Cards. Slide your CM3/4 in the module and the module in the ARMedONE: Done, up & ready to roll!
Since sustainability is a big topic to our hearts we settled with the SO-DIMM Standard. We are quite sure this standard will live for decades on! So the ARMedONE Carrier Board will be around quite a while and can be used over and over again without the need to ever change its hardware. Just take out your old modules and slide whatever precious piece of module you bought. ARMedONE got you covered!
 
Where?

The first Batch of the ARMedONE will launch on Kickstarter in mid 12.2022! So you see: Very soon! Cause we are so proud of this solution we’d like to get it to the world as fast humanly possible.
